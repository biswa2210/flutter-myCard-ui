## Making :point_down:
I have fetched the data from ncov_2019_api.http through [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) keys for app. I have used [FLUTTER](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjliHdMH2hA97bBGqJtW5ORUUksCxpZ8cnrSWaH__HevGftAmP8AmvIaAhNlEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) in front end and backend.
